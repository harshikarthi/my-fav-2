        <p>My hobby is painting.i love to paint with my brother. I mostly draw pictures of people, animals and birds. I use crayons, pencils, colour pencils etc to draw pictures. During birthdays of my parents, sister and friends, I gift my best paintings to them. I spend my free time drawing pictures. I got first prize in my school for the drawing competition. I love drawing girls with different hair styles. The hair styles i know are plaits, two sides, ponytail etc. I like to draw the sunset the most. I love drawing. I like to become an artist when I grow up.

            drawing is a particular hobby which i love it.
            without colours i can't imagine drawing because without colours the painting looks dull
            so drawing is the most perfect hobby for meThe first birthday gift I have received in my life is a drawing book and a box of crayons from my Uncle who is a renowned painter. I was just two years then.

            Uncle seated me on his lap took my hand and started drawing a small tree in the drawing book. He then helped me colour it. Slowly I picked up the art and started drawing all kinds of pictures.

            On every birthday, Uncle gifted me some article related to drawing. Drawing slowly became my favourite pastime. I grew very passionate about it. I experimented with all kinds of drawings. Not a single competition related to drawing missed my participation.

            Drawing has become a hobby inseparable from me. It is my steadfast companion in sorrow and happiness. Not a single day goes by that I do not draw anything. I thank my Uncle for gifting me my best friend.
